# procedural-islandgen

This is a program which procedurally generates a 2D island based on frequency, octave, and seed characteristics inputted by the user. Uses Perlin Noise to generate the islands. Built in C++ and Python.

## Examples

High Frequency Islands

![High Frequency 2](https://github.com/AmanRV/procedural-islandgen/blob/main/images/high-freq2.png?raw=true)


Medium Frequency Island

Low Frequency Island

## Terms

**Frequency**: Determines the level of detail of the islands.

**Amplitude**: Determines the weight of each noise layer.

**Octaves**: Combines multiple layers of different frequencies and amplitudes.
